## Create Custom ROS2 Interfaces (Msg and Srv)

If you read this, well, you’ve already made huge progress! The hardest is behind, now just a few more things and you’ll be ready to write your own complete ROS2 application.  In this quick section we’ll focus on ROS2 parameters.  Parameters will allow you to provide run-time settings for your nodes.  At the end of this section you will know:      What are ROS2 parameters and when to use them.      How to declare parameters for your nodes. How to get parameters from your node

## Scale Your Application With ROS2 Launch Files

So, you now have many nodes in your packages. When you start them, you can rename them, rename the topics, services, and set parameters.  That’s a lot of things! Now, imagine you have to start 10 nodes, each with a different configuration. Using the terminal is not something that scales well.  In this section we’ll see how to solve that problem with launch files.  At the end of this section you will be able to start all your nodes and parameters from one single ROS2 Launch File.  What you’ll do in this section:      Understand what launch files are and when to use them.      How to create, install, and start a launch file.      And another activity to practice on your own.
